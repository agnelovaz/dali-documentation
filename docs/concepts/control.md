# Controls

Controls are UI components that can be used in your application.

The DALi toolkit comes with a number of useful controls lile Buttons, ImageView, TextLabel, TextField and many more.

All Controls are derived from a common base class, developers can also derive from this and create their own controls.

The base class provides common behaviour and some virtual functions to aid in the quick constructions of new controls.

The main building box of controls are Visuals, visuals are the easiest way to display tet, images or models in your control.

Existing controls can be styled via a dali-toolkit stylesheet, specific properties on the control can be set here or through
the property system if at run-time.
